# Conservation-Status-Data-Analysis

## Introduction
This goal of this project is to analyze biodiversity data from the National Parks Service, particularly around various species observed in different national park locations.

This project will scope, analyze, prepare, plot data, and seek to explain the findings from the analysis.

Here are a few questions that this project has sought to answer:

What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?

## Data
This project has two data sets that came with the package. The first csv file has information about each species and another has observations of species with park locations. This data will be used to analyze the goals of the project.

## Conclusions

The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.
This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:

- What is the distribution of conservation status for species?
    - The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)
- Are certain types of species more likely to be endangered?
    - Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection.
- Are the differences between species and their conservation status significant?
    - Animals had a big difference in conservation percentage basing this on the chi squared test.
